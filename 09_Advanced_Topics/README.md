## ⚙️ 1. Iterators and Generators

### 🔹 **Iterators**

**Definition:**  
An *iterator* is an object that allows you to traverse (loop through) all the elements of a collection (like lists, tuples, or strings) **one element at a time** using the `iter()` and `next()` functions.

### Example:
```python
# Create a List (iterable)
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

# Convert the list into a iterator
it = iter(numbers)

# Access element one by one
print(next(it))  # 10
print(next(it))  # 20
print(next(it))  # 30
````

### 💡 DevOps Use Case:

Reading configuration files line by line or streaming logs without loading the entire file into memory.

---

### 🔹 **Generators**

**Definition:**
A *generator* is a special function that yields **one value at a time** using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. It saves memory compared to returning large lists.

### Example:

```python
def get_servers():
    for i in range(1, 4):
        yield f"server-{i}"

for s in get_servers():
    print(s)
```

**Output:**

```
server-1
server-2
server-3
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Stream server logs, API responses, or cloud resources efficiently without using excessive memory.

## 🎨 2. Decorators and Context Managers

### 🔹 **Decorators**

**Definition:**
A decorator is a function that adds functionality to another function **without modifying its structure** — often used for **logging, authentication, or timing.**

> You can think of decorators as **wrappers** around functions that add extra functionality.

### Example:
```python
def logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"📜 Running {func.__name__}...")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("✅ Completed.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@logger
def deploy_app():
    print("🚀 Deploying application...")

deploy_app()
```

#### **Output**:

```
📜 Running deploy_app...
🚀 Deploying application...
✅ Completed.
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Add logging or execution time measurement around automation tasks.

---

### 🔹 **Context Managers**

**Definition:**
A context manager is used to manage resources automatically (like opening/closing files or connections). It uses the `with` statement.

### Example:

```python
with open("deployment.log", "w") as log:
    log.write("Deployment started successfully.\n")
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Safely handle log files, SSH connections, or temporary files in automation scripts.

---

## 🔍 3. Regular Expressions (`re` module)

**Definition:**
Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to search, match, and manipulate text.

### Example 1: Find Email in Text

```python
import re

text = "Admin contact: admin@example.com"
match = re.search(r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+", text)
print("📧 Found Email:", match.group())
```

### Example 2: Extract IP Addresses

```python
logs = "Access from 192.168.1.10 and 10.0.0.5"
ips = re.findall(r"\b\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3}\b", logs)
print("🖥️ IPs:", ips)
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Extract IPs, error codes, or timestamps from server logs or monitoring data.

---

## ⚡ 4. Multithreading and Multiprocessing

### 🔹 **Multithreading**

**Definition:**
Multithreading means running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) **concurrently** to perform different tasks at the same time.

> 👉 Each thread runs in the same process memory, sharing variables and resources.

### Example:

```python
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Numbers Thread: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def print_letters():
    for ch in ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']:
        print(f"Letters Thread: {ch}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Creating threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Starting threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

# Waiting for both threads to finish
t1.join()
t2.join()

print("✅ Both threads completed!")

```
#### 🧭 Output (order may vary):
```
Numbers Thread: 1
Letters Thread: A
Numbers Thread: 2
Letters Thread: B
✅ Both threads completed!
```
> ⏱️ Both functions run concurrently, so the total execution time is much shorter than running them sequentially.

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Run parallel backups or deploy to multiple servers at once.

---

### 🔹 **Multiprocessing**

**Definition:**
Multiprocessing means running multiple processes simultaneously, where each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.

> 👉 Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), allowing true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores.

### Example:

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def square_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Square of {i} is : {i*i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def cube_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Cube of {i} is : {i*i*i}")
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Creating processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=square_numbers)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=cube_numbers)

    # Starting processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Waiting for both to complete
    p1.join()
    p2.join()

    print("✅ Both processes completed!")

```
#### Output (order may vary):
```
Square of 1 is : 1
Cube of 1 is : 1
Square of 2 is : 4
Cube of 2 is : 8
✅ Both processes completed!
```
> Each process runs independently on different CPU cores — truly in parallel.

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Process large datasets, compress logs, or analyze performance metrics in parallel.

## 🧩 5. Command-Line Arguments with `argparse`

**Definition:**
The `argparse` module allows scripts to accept arguments from the command line — making them reusable and configurable.

### Example:

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Deploy script")
parser.add_argument("--env", help="Environment name (dev/prod)")
args = parser.parse_args()

print(f"🚀 Deploying to {args.env} environment...")
```

Run it as:

```
python deploy.py --env=prod
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Parameterize automation scripts (e.g., deploy to `dev` or `prod`).

---

## 🔐 6. Working with Environment Variables

**Definition:**
Environment variables store sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or credentials outside the code.

### Example:

```python
import os

os.environ["ENV"] = "production"
print("Current Environment:", os.getenv("ENV"))
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Store AWS credentials, tokens, and secrets securely in environment variables rather than hardcoding them.

---

## ⏰ 7. Time and Scheduling Automation Scripts

### 🔹 **Time Module**

Used to measure execution time or delay task execution.

```python
import time

print("⏳ Starting backup...")
time.sleep(5)
print("✅ Backup completed after 5 seconds.")
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Schedule intervals between automated tasks (e.g., polling APIs, retries).

---

### 🔹 **Scheduling Scripts**

You can use Python’s `schedule` library to run tasks periodically.

### Example:

```python
import schedule
import time

def job():
    print("🔁 Checking server health...")

schedule.every(10).seconds.do(job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

💡 **DevOps Use Case:**
Monitor service uptime or automate cleanup tasks at intervals.
